# ghreview-ui

Frontend for the ghreview GitHub review center: a tabbed, keyboard-first PR
review UI that opens instantly from the warm `/v1` backend (`../ghreview`) —
**zero GitHub round trips in the open path**.

It is a **Svelte 5 + Vite** single-page app that ships as a cctui plugin and also
runs **standalone** against the backend for development. It shares the cctui
host's tooling (Svelte 5 runes, `@tanstack/svelte-query`, biome, vitest) and owns
its own minimal CSS with design tokens (every color is a CSS custom property in
`src/tokens.css`).

## Three ways this app runs

| mode | entry | backend reached by |
|---|---|---|
| standalone (dev) | `src/main.ts` → `App.svelte` | direct `fetch` + `Authorization: Bearer` |
| embedded (legacy) | `src/Review.svelte` | injected `baseUrl` + bearer |
| **cctui plugin** | `src/plugin.ts` → `ReviewPage.svelte` | `HostContext.pluginFetch` through the signed proxy |

All three share `Shell.svelte`; only the transport and the router differ.

## Plugin mode

`src/plugin.ts` default-exports `{ cctuiApi: 1, page: ReviewPage }`. The host mounts
`ReviewPage` with `PageProps { basePath, path, navigate }` and sets `HostContext`
under `HOST_CONTEXT_KEY` in Svelte context (see `src/lib/plugin/host.ts`).

- **Transport** — `ReviewPage` installs a `GhreviewTransport` (see
  `src/lib/api/config.ts`) whose `fetch` is `HostContext.pluginFetch`, so every
  `/v1/...` call goes to `/api/v1/plugins/ghreview/backend/v1/...` with cookie auth.
  **No bearer token exists in plugin mode**, and a stale standalone token in
  `localStorage` cannot leak into a request: the `Authorization` header is only set
  on the transport-less branch. SSE is an `EventSource` on the same proxy path.
- **Routing** — the host owns the URL. `ReviewPage` calls `router.adopt({ navigate })`
  and `router.setPath(path)`, so the router stops reading `window.location` and
  pushing history; navigations go back out through `PageProps.navigate`.
- **Backend gate** — the page probes `/v1/health` through the proxy on mount. Until
  an admin finishes the setup below, and whenever the backend is down, the page
  shows one "not configured or not reachable" state with the observed status and a
  Retry, instead of a wall of failing queries.

### Configuring an installed plugin

The plugin declares exactly one instance setting, `backendUrl`. The proxy signing
secret is **not** a setting: the server mints it on install (any manifest with a
`backend` block gets one), seals it, and returns it **once**.

1. Install the plugin. The install response carries `proxy_secret` once —
   `POST /api/v1/admin/plugins/ghreview/proxy-secret` rotates it and returns the new
   value, also once.
2. Set `GHREVIEW_PROXY_SECRET` on the ghreview deployment to that value.
3. Set the upstream:
   `PUT /api/v1/admin/plugins/ghreview/settings` with
   `{"values":{"backendUrl":"https://…"}}`, or the form in Settings › Plugins.
- **GitHub accounts** — PAT add/remove lives in the app now
  (`src/lib/components/GithubAccounts.svelte`, route `/accounts`), not in the host.

### Packaging

```sh
bun run build:plugin      # → dist/ghreview/{plugin.json,web/} and dist/ghreview-<ver>.tgz
```

`scripts/build-plugin.ts` runs `vite.plugin.config.ts` (Svelte and Tsumikit stay
external, resolved from the host's `/plugin-runtime/*`), writes `plugin.json`
(`id: ghreview`, `page`, `backend.upstreamSetting: "backendUrl"`,
`instanceSettings`, `styles`, `skills` when `skills/gh-review/SKILL.md` exists) and
tars the folder. `backend.upstreamSetting` must name a declared, non-secret `url`
setting or the server refuses the manifest at install. It fails if the bundle or the stylesheet is missing, or if the
archive exceeds the server's 5 MB limit.

Component CSS is injected at mount, but the plain stylesheet imports (tokens,
embed, markdown, syntax) cannot be — they build to one `web/index.css` that the
manifest declares in `styles[]` for the host to link.

## Standalone vs embedded

The same code runs two ways, selected by whether an embedder injects a runtime
config (`configureRuntime()` in `src/lib/api/config.ts`):

- **Standalone** — `src/main.ts` mounts `App.svelte`, which shows the token
  `AuthGate` and reads backend URL / token / account from `localStorage` +
  `VITE_*` env. `main.ts` imports `src/app.css` (document-level base rules).
- **Embedded** — `cctui-ui` imports `src/Review.svelte` and passes
  `{ baseUrl, token, account?, basePath }` as props. `Review` injects them via
  `configureRuntime()` (so the API client + SSE use the host's URL + bearer, no
  login stub), mounts the shared `Shell.svelte`, and imports `src/embed.css` —
  which reuses `src/tokens.css` but scopes the base rules under `.ghreview-embed`
  so they never leak onto the host's `<body>`. The theme lives on the embed
  container (not `<html>`), so switching it never touches the cctui chrome. The
  router runs under `basePath` (`/review`) while the GitHub-mirrored paths stay
  intact.

`src/main.ts` and `App.svelte` keep their standalone behaviour unchanged.

## Run standalone against the backend

```sh
mise use bun@latest        # or use the repo's mise shims
bun install
GHREVIEW_URL=http://localhost:8790 bun run dev   # vite dev server on :5290
```

Run the backend in its loopback-only anonymous mode for this
(`GHREVIEW_AUTH_MODE=none GHREVIEW_UNSAFE_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true`): see _Auth_ below
for why standalone SSE has no other option.

The dev server proxies `/v1` (including `/v1/events` SSE) to `GHREVIEW_URL`
(default `http://localhost:8790`), so the app is same-origin in dev. For a hosted
build, set `VITE_GHREVIEW_URL` to the backend origin at build time instead.

### Auth

Three cases, in descending order of how much you should rely on them:

- **Plugin** — no token anywhere. The proxy authenticates the cctui session cookie
  and signs `X-Cctui-*` identity headers the backend verifies. `EventSource` hits
  the proxy path directly and the cookie rides along because it is same-origin.
- **Embedded (legacy)** — cctui-ui injects a bearer minted for the signed-in user,
  sent as `Authorization: Bearer …` on every `/v1` call.
- **Standalone** — the `AuthGate` prompts for a token and stores it in
  `localStorage` (`ghreview:token`) with an optional default account
  (`ghreview:account`); `VITE_GHREVIEW_TOKEN` / `VITE_GHREVIEW_ACCOUNT` seed these
  for local dev. **SSE cannot be authenticated in this mode.** `EventSource` cannot
  set a request header and the backend no longer reads a token from the query
  string (a credential in a URL lands in every access log), so `/v1/events` only
  works against a backend in `GHREVIEW_AUTH_MODE=none`, which refuses to boot
  without `GHREVIEW_UNSAFE_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS=true` and binds to `127.0.0.1` only.
  Plain `/v1` fetches still authenticate normally with the bearer header.

## Commands

```sh
bun run dev         # vite dev server (proxies /v1 to GHREVIEW_URL)
bun run build       # production build to dist/
bun run check       # typecheck (svelte-check) + lint (biome) + tests (vitest) — the gate
bun run test        # vitest only
```

## Architecture

- **Data layer** (`src/lib/api/`) — generated `/v1` types (`src/generated/api.ts`,
  copied verbatim from `ghreview/src/generated/api.ts`), a thin bearer-token
  `fetch` wrapper (`client.ts`), tanstack-query keys/options (`queries.ts`), and
  GitHub-payload narrowing (`types.ts`). Envelopes' `payload` is narrowed with
  hand-written minimal GitHub-shaped interfaces (no octokit dependency pulled in).
- **SSE** (`api/sse.ts`) — subscribes to `/v1/events` and turns each change hint
  (`pr.updated` / `pr.viewed_state.updated` / `notification.*` / `sync.status`) into
  tanstack cache invalidations. **No polling in the UI.** `sseActions()` is a pure
  map that is unit-tested; the EventSource wiring is a thin shell around it.
- **Router** (`src/lib/router/`) — a tiny history router. Routes mirror GitHub:
  `/` (PR list + filters), `/inbox` (notifications), `/bookmarklet`, and
  `/:owner/:repo/pull/:number` (PR view). `parseRoute()` is pure/tested.
- **Tabs** (`src/lib/stores/`) — deterministic PR-coordinate ids
  (`pr-<owner>-<repo>-<number>`), idempotent open, adjacent-selection close,
  localStorage restore with validation/fallback. All reducer logic lives in
  `tabs-core.ts` (pure, fully unit-tested); `tabs.svelte.ts` is the `$state` +
  persistence wrapper. Per-tab status dot (pr/ci/mergeable) is driven from synced
  PR data and refreshed live via SSE.
- **Diff** (`src/lib/diff/`) — `parse.ts` turns each file's unified `patch` (from
  the stored GitHub files payload) into a flat row model with correct old/new line
  numbers and first-class file/hunk rows; `navindex.ts` pre-computes the
  file/hunk navigation index (O(1) j/k stepping); `virtual.ts` is the fixed-row
  windowing math; `split.ts` derives the side-by-side row model from the same
  unified model; `highlight.ts` wraps a slim highlight.js core (per-extension
  language map) behind a memoizing per-line cache. `components/DiffView.svelte` is
  the single renderer: virtualized DOM rows, unified or split.
- **Viewed state** (`src/lib/diff/tree.ts`, `collapse.ts`, `api/viewed.ts`) —
  `buildFileTree()` turns the flat file list into a nested,
  single-child-compressed directory tree; `FileTree.svelte` renders per-file and
  per-folder checkboxes with `n/m` progress (a folder toggle cascades to every file
  beneath). Marking a file viewed collapses it via `collapseViewedFiles()`, a pure
  row-model transform that drops a viewed file's body
  rows and leaves a "viewed — N lines hidden" header stub (clicking the file in the
  tree peek-expands it). State comes from `GET …/pulls/{n}/viewed` via tanstack query
  and live `pr.viewed_state.updated` SSE; toggles are optimistic
  (`applyOptimisticViewed`) with rollback on error. `tree.ts`, `collapse.ts` and
  `viewed.ts` are pure; `tree.ts` and `viewed.ts` have their own test files, and
  `collapse.ts` is covered by the `collapseViewedFiles` cases in `tree.test.ts`.

## Themes

Four first-class themes, selected by a `data-theme` attribute — on `<html>`
standalone, or on the `.ghreview-embed` container when embedded (so the host's
theme is untouched): **dark** (default, matches cctui), **light**,
**colorblind-dark**, **colorblind-light**. `src/lib/theme/theme.ts` owns
selection: the resolved theme is an explicit `localStorage` choice
(`ghreview:theme`), else `prefers-color-scheme`, else dark. `initTheme()` applies
it in `main.ts` before mount (no flash); the top-bar `<select>` persists changes
via `setTheme()` standalone or the embed theme context.

All colors are CSS custom properties in `src/tokens.css` (shared by both the
standalone `src/app.css` and the embedded `src/embed.css`), grouped in semantic
tiers:

- **Chrome** — surface (`--gh-bg`, `--gh-bg-elev`, `--gh-bg-inset`), text
  (`--gh-fg`, `--gh-fg-muted`, `--gh-fg-subtle`), border, accent, status.
- **Diff** — `--gh-diff-{add,del,context}-{bg,fg}`, `--gh-diff-gutter-{bg,fg}`,
  `--gh-diff-hunk-{bg,fg}`, plus non-color encoding: `--gh-diff-{add,del}-edge`
  (left bar) and `--gh-diff-{add,del}-glyph` (the always-rendered `+`/`−` gutter
  markers). Colorblind themes swap red/green for a blue/orange (deuteranopia/
  protanopia-safe) palette; the edge bar + glyph mean add/remove never rely on hue.
- **Syntax** — an 8-color scale `--gh-syn-{keyword,string,number,comment,function,`
  `variable,type,punctuation}` per theme, mapped onto highlight.js token classes in
  `src/lib/markdown/hljs-tokens.css`.

**Tokens contract.** `DiffView.svelte` styles itself with these CSS variables
directly and hardcodes no colors; adding a color means adding a token, not a literal.

WCAG AA (≥4.5:1) is enforced by `src/lib/theme/contrast.test.ts`, which parses the
`data-theme` blocks out of `tokens.css` and asserts text and diff fg/bg pairs across
all four themes.

## Keyboard map

Implemented (input/textarea-guarded):

- `j` / `k` — next / previous **hunk**
- `J` / `K` — next / previous **file**
- `g` then `d` — jump to the diff (first hunk)
- `Cmd/Ctrl+1..9` — select tab _n_ · `Cmd/Ctrl+W` — close current tab ·
  middle-click / `×` — close tab
- `v` — toggle **viewed** on the file under the cursor
- `Cmd/Ctrl+K` — open command palette (action wired; palette UI is **deferred**)

## Performance — the <100ms open target

Requirement #1 is instant opens. How it's met:

- **Open reads from cache, not the network.** Opening a PR tab renders
  synchronously from the warm tanstack cache: `PrView`'s query seeds `initialData`
  from `queryClient.getQueryData(["pull", …])`, so if the PR list (or a prior open)
  already warmed the record, the header + diff paint on the first frame with zero
  awaits. A background refetch reconciles, and SSE pushes later updates.
- **The parse/index path is cheap and virtualized.** `src/lib/diff/perf.test.ts`
  parses + nav-indexes a **50-file, ~10k-line** working set and asserts it
  completes in **< 100ms** (typically a few ms), and that windowing a 10k-row diff
  yields a small visible slice in O(1) — that single `computeWindow` assertion is
  the only coverage `virtual.ts` has. Rows render fixed-height and virtualized, so
  only the visible window plus overscan is ever in the DOM.
- **Highlighting is memoized, not repeated per frame.** `highlight.ts` exposes
  `highlightLineCached` — a bounded `Map` keyed by `(lang, line content)`. A row is
  highlighted the first time it scrolls into the window and is a cache hit forever
  after, so scrolling back and forth costs map lookups instead of `hljs.highlight()`
  passes. `highlight.test.ts` pins this with a spy on the underlying highlighter.

No frame-rate number is claimed here: nothing in this repo measures paint or frame
time, and jsdom/happy-dom cannot. Treat the tests above as algorithmic-cost
tripwires and profile in a real browser if you need frame numbers.

## Deferred

- The command-palette UI + fuzzy file finder (the `Cmd/Ctrl+K` keybind resolves to
  an `openPalette` action; nothing renders it yet).
- Modified-line pairing with inline word/character diff.
- Server-remembered open-tab sets.

## Regenerating the API types

`src/generated/api.ts` is a verbatim copy of the backend's generated client
(`ghreview/src/generated/api.ts`). After a `/v1` contract change, refresh it:

```sh
cp ../ghreview/src/generated/api.ts src/generated/api.ts
```
